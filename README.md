## My short bio

I am an Associate Professor at the University of Idaho, which I joined in the spring of 2011 as an Assistant Professor. My main research focus has been Mathematics of Medical Imaging (a.k.a, Tomograph). My (unupdated) faculty webpage can be found [here](https://webpages.uidaho.edu/lnguyen/). 

I also hold a High Level Expert position at Industrial University of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, where I helped found the Data Innovation Lab. I am also the Admin of [DatAI@SG](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2228672460739416/), a Facebook group  dedicated to connecting the Data Science & AI community in Vietnam. 

Together with some friends, I lead the project [DamsanX](https://damsanx.ai). Its goal is to build an advising system for Data Science & AI learners.
